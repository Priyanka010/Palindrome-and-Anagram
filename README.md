# Palindrome-and-Anagram
Searching a file for palindromes and anagrams.


Palindromes – words that read the same either way e.g. radar, civic, level, anna


Anagrams – words made from the letters of another word e.g. cineasts ↔ acnestis

Here, the input is a plain text file called 'English.txt', containing some four hundred thousand words, from which we can find all possible anagram and palindromes. You can replace the file with any text file in this code and find the correct output. 

Hope it helps you to get an understanding of Palindrome, anagram and files in Python. :)
